My first day in GNDEC started with path and shabad kirtan in college's gurudwara sahid. The atmosphere was calm and filled with position vibes. The raggi singh was performing very good kirtan. After ardas we got refreshment and then we arrived in the college's auditorium. we waited for 15 minutes and after that principal sir and cheif guest entered into auditorium. First speech was given by principal sir, they told us college history and previous performance of college. Then chief guest maheshinder singh president of Nanakana sahib trust came on stage. They told us brief history of college. They shares his life experience with us. After lunch break, we took a round of our labs and some information about our courses.
